# A Janggi Game
<b>Objective</b><br>
<p>This project started off as a final project for a class at Oregon State University that ended in March 2021. After completing the class, I decided to extend the project in order to make it fully functional and to give it a graphical user interface. Once that is complete, I plan to create a AI computer player and use reinforced learning to improve its performance.</p>
