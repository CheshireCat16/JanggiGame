# A Janggi Game
<b>Objective</b><br>
<p>This project started off as a final project for a class at Oregon State University that ended in March 2021. After completing the class, I decided to extend the project in order to make it fully functional and to give it a graphical user interface. Once that is complete, I plan to create a AI computer player and use reinforced learning to improve its performance.</p><br>
<b>Update - March 21, 2021</b><br>
<p>I have completed the implementation of a basic user interface using the pygame library. The game is currently playable by two human players on the same computer who take turns using the mouse.</p>
<p>The next step in the development plan will be to add rules related to <i>bikjang</i>, when two generals face each other across the board, and draws. Once that is complete, I can begin work on the AI player.</p>
